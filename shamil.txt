Here's a Python function that counts the number of vowels in a given string:

```
def count_vowels(s):
    return sum(1 for c in s.lower() if c in 'aeiou')
```

Explanation:

- `s.lower()`: converts the string to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
- `c in 'aeiou'`: checks if each character is a vowel
- `sum(...)`: counts the total number of vowels

Example usage:

```
print(count_vowels("Hello World"))  # Output: 3
```

Alternatively, you can use regular expressions:

```
import re

def count_vowels(s):
    return len(re.findall('[aeiou]', s, flags=re.IGNORECASE))
```

Or, using a more traditional loop approach:

```
def count_vowels(s):
    count = 0
    for c in s.lower():
        if c in 'aeiou':
            count += 1
    return count
```

All of these functions will give the same result.

If you want to count vowels in a specific case (e.g., only uppercase or lowercase), adjust the comparison accordingly.
